* HolscherHead's Sucky Shell Scripts
Most of these are meant to just roll several commands into one. Nothing too fancy.

* The Scripts:
mnt & umnt- OpenBSD script to mount & unmount a drive with fuzzy finder.
samd- Literally just sam -d. Created as a workaround for enviroment variables.
bmk- fzf script for opening a bookmark.
tmus- A simple fzf script that plays music. Meant to be run in a tmux popup.
- dwinkill: For people who want to remove dwm's ability to close a window. Depends on wmutils.
- masstube: Mass downloads videos. Will accept youtube-dl arguments.
- mutt: Runs mailcap & neomutt. Conflicts with mutt. For use with mutt wizard.
- pitch: Pitches sounds down using ffmpeg
- update: Updates all pacman packages & cleans out the cache
- w3tor: Runs w3m over tor. Cleans out your browsing history & cookies when you're done.
- cast: Converts video files to audio files, then moves them to a storage device (such as an mp3 player)
- musicmenu: A simple dmenu script that plays music
- paper: A dmenu script that changes your wallpaper, & your theme using pywal. Depends on my dotfiles for the postrun script.
- reload: reloads sxhkd. Stolen from the dotfiles linked to the dwmc page on suckless.org
- udisksmenu: Mount or unmount a storage device with dmenu
- wiki: A posix-compliant rework of Derek Taylor's dm-wiki. Uses fuzzy finder instead of dmenu
- copy: Puts things that were in the unusable clipboard into the usable one.
